Low-level programming is often described as machine-oriented. It is also close to computer peripherals and requires knowledge of the processor's instructions and orientation within the relationships of internal systems or related devices.

Low-level programming aims to guide a specific language compiler to use machine code instructions that will perform the tasks in the fastest and safest possible way, using the minimum amount of memory. It often uses the individual advantages of the core or system periphery to achieve this.
